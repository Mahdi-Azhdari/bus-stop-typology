# MBTA Bus Stop Typology Analysis

This repository contains the code and Jupyter notebooks used to develop a stop-level typology for the MBTA bus network using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and interpretable machine-learning methods such as Random Forests, SHAP, and XGBoost. The workflow includes data preprocessing, clustering, model explanation, and model validation.
